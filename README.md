Secret Code Game - JavaScript

This was one of the first JavaScript projects I created during my software bootcamp. I had made the equivalent in Java and wanted to try it out in JS. The goal of the game is to guess the secret five-digit code by guessing five numbers each round. After each guess, the computer lets the player know how many digits they placed correctly, how many digits they entered that are in the code but are in the incorrect spot, and how many digits they entered that are not in the code at all. The game keeps track of each guess and each result so the player can refer back to them to help them solve the puzzle. 

This project was created using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
